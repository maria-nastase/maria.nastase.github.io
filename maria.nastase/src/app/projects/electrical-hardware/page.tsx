    shortDescription: "PCB that gradually ramps tube furnace to 1100 Â°C. ",
    longDescription:
      `A PCB that controls the temperature of a tube furnace to be used for thermal oxidation and annealing in semiconductor fabrication. It gets the temperature reading from a thermocouple, which is shown on an LCD display, and controls a variac which heats up the Tungsten heating element.
      
      The system was first prototyped on a breadboard using an Arduino Uno, before designing the PCB in KiCad with an ESP32 and soldering the components. Currently working on fine-tuning the PID parameters to optimize the rate of heating and cooling while remaining within safe limits.`,

    longDescription:
      `This PCB controls a motor for the rotation of a spin coater, which is used in semiconductor fabrication to apply uniform thin films of photoresist on silicon wafers.
      
      The through-hole and surface mount components (as small as 0603) were soldered by hand.`,
